# Installation

Ayakashi runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  
If you don't have node installed in your system please go ahead and install it first.  
The latest LTS release is **recommended**.  
<br/>
Then install Ayakashi as a global module:

```bash
npm install -g ayakashi
```

The above command will install Ayakashi and make it available globally in your system.  
<br/>
More installation options will be available in the future.

## Updating

To update Ayakashi to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm update -g ayakashi
```
