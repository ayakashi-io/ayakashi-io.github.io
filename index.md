# Getting started

You might want to start with [installing](/docs/installation) ayakashi in your system,
it's pretty simple and quick.

## How to read the guide

You can start by reading the [guide](/docs/guide) from top to bottom.  
It will start by explaining the core concepts and build upon them
as it moves along.  
By the end of it you will be able to build some pretty impressive systems.

## Going deeper

The [going deeper](/docs/going-deeper) section will explain certain things in
more detail and introduce more features that will certainly come in handy.

## Going meta

The [advanced](/docs/advanced) section will demonstrate how to extend
the framework by creating your own actions, extractors and preloaders.  
Give it a quick read even if you don't need the extra power right now.
